## Key Documentation

- Links to this documentation set
- Links to the project README
- Links to data format specifications
- Links to ITPI dashboard documentation
- Links to medical school policies

## Architecture Quick Start

- 5-minute overview of the system architecture
- Link to full [System Overview](../01-architecture/system-overview.md)
- Key things to understand before writing code:
  - Single-file application structure
