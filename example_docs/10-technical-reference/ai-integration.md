# AI Integration Reference

## Overview

The LU Medical School Attendance Tracker does not have AI integration capabilities. This application is a data analysis and visualization tool for student attendance tracking without AI features.

## Data Analysis Approach

- Statistical analysis using Pandas for attendance calculations
- Pattern matching using regular expressions for placement categorization
- Data visualization using Plotly for charts and graphs
- All analysis is rule-based and deterministic

## Future Considerations

- Potential for ML-based attendance prediction (not implemented)
- AI-powered anomaly detection for attendance patterns (not implemented)
- Natural language processing for notes analysis (not implemented)
- Any AI features would require significant architectural changes
